This issue tracker is for problems with the source code repository (e.g., its structure, package file, compilation process, organization, etc.), not for problems with the MathJax code itself.  If you are reporting a bug in how MathJax works, please use the [MathJax issue tracker](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/issues), rather than this one, so that all the issues are in one place for easier searching and sorting.

If you are not part of the MathJax team, it is unlikely that you should be posting an issue here.  Use the tracker linked above instead.
